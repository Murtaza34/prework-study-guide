# <Web Devlopment Study Guide>

## Description

I created this project becuase I wanted to test my coding skills and knowledge that I had gained so far from the prework. But, most importantly it gave me the oppertunity to see what it feels like to be a web developer.

This project has taught me many new things that I had not known before. I really enjoyed learning Git and Github, these two things really made it so simple in accessing projects and being able to track any changes.
